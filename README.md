# Work-From-Home Soundscapes

Ah, working remotely from a tranquil corner of your home. Is there anything better? Until the noises start, that is. Eliminating those is a key to mastering the art of working remotely. Yes, this is a parody of quality ambient noise generators like Noisli and Coffitivity. Stick around if leaf blowers are your jam ... we won't judge!
