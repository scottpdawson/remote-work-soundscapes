# Work-From-Home Soundscapes

I created this application as a parody of ambient noise generators. It's a React-based application that allows you to play different mp3 files concurrently, each at a different volume. You can easily add/remove sounds by updating the ```Constants.ts``` file.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```
